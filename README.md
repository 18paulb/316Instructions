# Creating and Editing a Simple Webpage

# Introduction
In this day and age, everything requires a website. Through these instructions, you will learn basic editing of HTML and CSS, the building blocks of websites. You will be using a website called CodePen, in which there will be three sections titled HTML, CSS, and JS. The webpage will be displayed underneath. You will be editing the HTML and CSS sections.

# List of Requirements:
1. A computer
2. A stable internet connection

# Numbered Steps
1. Open this link in a new tab: https://codepen.io/18paulb/pen/abeOKgd
2. Collapse the JS section. We won't be using it.

### Altering Name Heading
1. In the HTML section (on the left), find the text that says `Hello {Name}`.
2. Replace `{Name}` with your name.
3. In the CSS section (on the right), find the following code:
   ```
   .box {
    font-size: 10px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
   }
   ```
4. Change the line that says `font-size: 10px;` to say `font-size: 40px;` (make sure to keep the semicolon)
5. The header should get larger automatically after a few seconds.

The updated page should look similar to this:
![changed header](./images/changedHeader.png)

### Changing The Image
1. Go to Google Images and find an appropriate image of your choice.
2. Right click on the image (two finger click on trackpad) and choose `Copy Image Link` or `Copy Image Address` from the dropdown menu.
3. Navigate back to CodePen.
4. In the HTML Section, find this line:
```
    <img class="photo" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Cat_August_2010-4.jpg/1200px-Cat_August_2010-4.jpg">
```
5. Delete the url found after the `src=` and paste the new one you copied (make sure that you keep the quotes around the link).

The updated page should look similar to this:
![changed image](./images/changedImage.png)

### Changing Body Text
1. In the HTML Section, find where it has this code:
```
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
```
2. Change the text inside of the `<p></p>` tags to be a description of how your day was today:
   ```<p>My day was great!</p>```

The updated page should look similar to this:
![changed body](./images/changedText.png)

### Changing Background Color
1. In the CSS section, find this code:
```
body {
  font-family: system-ui;
  background: orange;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}
```
2. Change the background color by changing `background: orange;` to `background: green;` (make sure not to delete the semicolon at the end of the line)
3. If you'd like, you can try using a different color than green.

The updated page should look similar to this:
![changed background](./images/changedBackground.png)

# Comments, Notes, and Examples

# Troubleshooting
 - If the image you chose from Google Images isn't showing up:
    - Make sure the image link is surrounded by quotes: `"www.example.com/image"`
    - Choose a new image to try instead.
 - If any changes aren't showing up:
    - Check the CSS section for any missing semicolons at the end of lines.
    - Check the HTML section and make sure you haven't deleted any of the tags (things in `<>` brackets)

# Hazard Statements

### Caution 
If you refresh the CodePen page, you will lose all your progress.

# Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully edited a simple webpage using HTML and CSS. Youâ€™ve learned how to modify text, change an image, update the body content, and alter the background color. These basic steps provide a starting point for editing and personalizing websites. With a bit of practice, you can try making more changes and exploring other features of HTML and CSS to further customize webpages as you become more comfortable with the process.
