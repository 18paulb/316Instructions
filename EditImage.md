### Edit the Image

First, find an image to use. Search on Google for an image of your choice, right click it, and choose "Copy Image URL" in the dropdown menu.

Navigate back to the CodePen, and in the HTML section, find the `<img>` tag on line (line number).

maybe insert screenshot of img tag here (with src="..." highlighted)

Modify the `<img>` tag to replace the URL of the cat with the URL you just copied.
